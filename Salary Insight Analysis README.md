## Introduction
This project aims to analyze salary data across different job titles, employment types, company sizes, remote work ratios, and
geographical locations within the tech industry. The goal is to uncover trends and provide insights into how various factors influence
salaries. The findings are presented through an interactive dashboard created using Power BI.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, which offers a comprehensive dataset on tech industry salaries.

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: Utilized for initial data cleaning, manipulation, and formatting.

Power BI: Used for creating visualizations and building the comprehensive salary insights dashboard.

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation
The data cleaning and manipulation process involved several key steps:

- Conditional Formatting: Applied conditional formatting in Excel to identify and highlight any blanks or errors within the dataset.
- Duplicate Check: Conducted thorough checks for duplicate entries and removed any duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
- Missing Values: Filled in missing values where necessary to ensure the completeness of the dataset.
- Column Formatting: Formatted columns to ensure consistency, including converting dates to a standard format and expressing the remote ratio as a percentage.
- VLOOKUP: Used VLOOKUP to replace acronyms in the dataset with their full names to improve readability and comprehension during visualizatio


## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Key Questions Answered

- What is the distribution of salaries across different job titles, experience levels, and employment types?
- How does salary vary with experience level and company location?
- Is there a correlation between remote ratio and salary?
- Are there any significant differences in salaries based on company size?
-How does the salary distribution differ between different employee residences?

2. ## Salary by Employment Type

### Visualization: Funnel chart
### Observation: 
Contract roles tend to have higher average salaries compared to full-time, freelancer, and part-time roles.
### Insight: 
Contract roles often offer higher pay to compensate for the lack of job security and benefits that come with full-time employment. 
Freelancers and part-time employees tend to earn less due to the nature of their work arrangements.

3. ## Salary Based on Company Size and Remote Ratio
### Visualization: Combined bar and line chart
### Observation: 
Medium-sized companies have a higher remote work ratio and competitive salaries, while large companies offer the
highest salaries but with a lower remote work ratio.

### Insight: 
Medium-sized companies may offer more remote work opportunities to attract talent and remain competitive, whereas large 
companies can afford to pay higher salaries but may prefer in-office work environments for better team coordination.

4. ## Salary by Remote Ratio
### Visualization: Donut chart
### Observation: 
Salaries are distributed across different remote work ratios, with significant portions at 0%, 50%, and 100% remote.

### Insight: 
Higher salaries are observed in roles that offer full remote work. This can be attributed to:

- Access to a Global Talent Pool: Companies offering 100% remote work can attract talent from anywhere in the world, 
often resulting in higher salaries to compete globally.

- Attraction and Retention: To attract and retain top talent who value flexibility, companies may offer premium salaries.
  
- Operational Cost Savings: Savings from reduced physical office space can be redirected to higher salaries for remote employees.
  
- Specialized Roles: Roles that can be performed entirely remotely are often in high demand and require specialized skills,
  thus commanding higher salaries

  For 0% Remote Ratio, lower salaries might be due to companies requiring on-site presence, which may limit the talent
  pool to local candidates, potentially lowering competitive salaries. 50% offers mixed remote work ratios which may indicate
  flexible work environments. These roles might offer moderate salaries to balance the benefits of flexibility and the
  need for some on-site presence.

### Insight: 
Higher experience levels command higher salaries due to the expertise, responsibility, and leadership skills required at 
senior positions. This trend is typical in most industries, reflecting the value of experience and tenure.
