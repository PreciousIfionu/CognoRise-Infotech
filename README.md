### UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN INDIA 
## (2019 - 2020)
### Introduction

Hello, I'm Precious Ifionu, an intern at CognoRise Infotech. This project focuses on analyzing the unemployment rate in India during the period from 2019 to 2020. The primary objective is to uncover trends, identify regional disparities, and provide insights that can guide policy decisions and interventions.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), India. It includes comprehensive data on the unemployment rate, employment rate, labor participation rate, and demographic details across various regions in India.

### Columns in the Dataset:
- Regions: Geographical areas within India.

- Dates: Monthly data points.

- Frequency: Monthly.

- Estimated Unemployment Rate (%): Percentage of unemployed individuals.

- Estimated Employment Rate: Absolute number of employed individuals.

- Estimated Labor Participation Rate (%): Percentage of the labor force that is actively participating in the job market.

- Area: Classification into rural and urban regions.
  

### Tools Used

 - Microsoft Excel: Utilized for initial data cleaning and manipulation tasks.
 - Microsoft Power BI: Employed for data visualization and dashboard creation.

### Data Cleaning and Manipulation

#### Step-by-Step Documentation:

1. #### Handling Missing Values:

- Identification: Identified rows with missing dates and values.
- Imputation: Filled in missing dates to maintain chronological consistency using interpolation techniques where necessary.
- Validation: Ensured no critical data was omitted in the process.
  

2. #### Correcting Data Types:

- Date Formatting: Converted text-formatted dates into standard date formats to facilitate time series analysis.
- Percentage Calculations: Ensured tha
  
  
3. #### Transformations:

- Percentage Calculations: Calculated employment rates and labor participation rates as percentages for consistency.
- Standardization: Standardized all numerical values to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
  
  
4. #### Removing Duplicates:

- Verification: Checked for and removed any duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

5. #### Data Verification:

- Cross-Validation: Cross-checked the cleaned dataset against the original data source to ensure accuracy and completeness.

  
### Summary of Data Analysis

The analysis aimed to provide a detailed understanding of the unemployment trends in India. By examining how the unemployment rate varied over time and across different regions, the study sought to identify key patterns and relationships.


#### Key Questions Addressed:

- Temporal Trends: How did the unemployment rate change over time?
- Regional Disparities: Which regions experienced the highest and lowest unemployment rates?
- Labor Participation: What is the relationship between the unemployment rate and the labor participation rate?


### Key Visualizations and Findings

1. #### Labor Participation Rate by Year
   ##### Visualization: Line Chart

#### Analysis:
The labor participation rate fluctuated significantly between July 2019 and May 2020. The peak was observed around October 2019, indicating a high engagement in the labor market. However, the rate experienced a downward trend entering 2020, likely due to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall participation rate stabilized around mid-2020 but remained lower compared to the peak.

2. #### Unemployment Rate by Year
   ##### Visualization: Line Chart
   
   #### Analysis:
The unemployment rate exhibited a sharp increase at the beginning of 2020, correlating with the economic impact of COVID-19. This spike reflects the significant job losses and reduction in economic activities during the early months of the pandemic. A gradual decline is observed post-April 2020, suggesting a slow recovery in employment as restrictions eased and economic activities resumed.
